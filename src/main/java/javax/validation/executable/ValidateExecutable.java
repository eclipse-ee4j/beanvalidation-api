/**
 * Expresses which executable (method or constructor) should have its parameters
 * and return value validated upon execution.
 *
 * The settings for a given executable is resolved as followed.
 * A given executable is validated upon execution:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>if it is annotated with {@code @ValidateExecutable} and the {@code type} attribute
 *     contains the executable type. If the {@code type} attribute does not contain the
 *     executable type, the executable is not validated.</li>
 *     <li>otherwise if,
 *     the type (class, interface) on which the executable is defined
 *     is annotated with {@code @ValidateExecutable} and the {@code type} attribute
 *     contains the executable type. If the {@code type} attribute does not contain the
 *     executable type, the executable is not validated.</li>
 *     <li>otherwise if the global executable validation setting contains the executable
 *     type. If the global setting does not contain the executable type, the executable
 *     is not validated.</li>
 *     <li>The rules above do not apply to methods overriding a superclass method or
 *     implementing an interface method. In this case, the method inherits the behavior
 *     of the method it overrides / implements</li>
 * </ul>
